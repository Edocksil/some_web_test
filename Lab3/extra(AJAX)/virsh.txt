When I first saw him, I was really scared!
We came with three men, and got fully prepared.
Standing in the corner there against the wall!
looking like a giant white concrete rubber doll!
Then I walked to him like really close!
I looked at his face, but it had no nose?!
Then something went just terribly wrong!
And this is just a part of the 173-song.

There was a problem with the doors and the electricity too!
And before I knew he was out of my view!
Standing behind my friend his back,
he killed him with one single attack!
Short after that he killed my other mate,
and then I just became really afraid!
Standing there in front me!
And my pants came wet due I had to pee!
He didn't move and I like what the heck?!
And suddenly I blinked and he snapped my neck!

He is so cute and very brute!
He wears no suit and loves pursuit!

Now I'm here alone, but I don't mind!
My two best mates I sure will miss!
173 is one of a kind,
and you'll never know what he really is!
Let's get moving, I'm out of here!
I'm so scared, I know he's near!
He'll come for me, but we don't know when!
Oh, no! There he is again!
